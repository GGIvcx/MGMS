# What does the Plugin do?
This plugin is designed to make the drops from gold mined with a golden pickaxe more logical.
By default, gold mined with a golden pickaxe does not drop anything. This plugin removes that game mechanic.
It adds drops that also respect the Silk Touch and Fortune enchantments when mining gold ore, deepslate gold ore, or blocks of raw gold with a golden pickaxe.
